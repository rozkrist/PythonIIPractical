I again looked at presentation and started to add some info in there in first slides. Feel free to adjust if you have any thoughts.  Also I looked at data we have and manipulations and seems that data transformation & integration can be put together in one slide as we have pretty clean data here so nothing much to add as key points in 2 slides separately, adjusted the presentation as well.  In slide "Data Storing&Extraction"
